Trying to recreate XGIS functionality. Or at the very least some of it.

Gives a visual map of certain data in each of the counties in Estonia.
Tried to make a simplified clone of this website just to try and learn. https://xgis.maaamet.ee/xgis2/page/app/statistika


1. git clone https://github.com/raikustar/xgis-replica-openlayers

2. cd xgis-replica-openlayers

3. npm install

4. npm run dev (use Windows CLI, Git Bash a bit wonky)
